# High Performance Scientific Computing in Aerospace - Module 1

This repository has been developed for Module 1 of the "High Performance Scientific Computing in Aerospace" course at Politecnico di Milano, taught by Professor Franco Auteri.  
The code initially addresses the heat equation in a basic 1D time-invariant setup, then advances to handle progressively more complex and realistic scenarios.

### Required Libraries
The following libraries are required to execute all the code in the repository:
1. Eigen (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
2. MPI
3. 2decomp_fft (https://2decomp-fft.github.io/)
