# High Performance Scientific Computing in Aerospace - Module 1

The repository contains the code developed for Module 1 of the "High Performance Scientific Computing in Aerospace" course at Politecnico di Milano, taught by Professor Franco Auteri.

Contained within are the scripts tailored to address the heat equation. Beginning with a basic 1D time-invariant scenario, the code progresses to handle more intricate situations, adapting to more realistic scenarios. 

### Required Libraries
To execute all the code in the repository, you'll need to have the following three libraries installed:
1. Eigen (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
2. MPI
3. 2decomp_fft (https://2decomp-fft.github.io/)
